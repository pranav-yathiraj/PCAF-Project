# PCAF-Projects
A repository of my PCAF associated project. 
Here, I will be developing a financed and facilitated emissions inventory for a simulated global Custodian bank portfolio. I will be creating multiple modelled scenarios for different attribution factors depending on estimation appetite. I will also be modelling scenarios for different weighting factors depending on risk appetite.
