Simulation Methodology: The $616B portfolio used in this tool is a synthetic dataset generated via Gemini 3 Flash. 
The sector-wise exposure, utilization rates, and emission profiles were modeled to reflect real-world banking concentrations (e.g., high Sovereign Debt vs. high-intensity Power Generation).

The following prompt was used on Gemini AI 

Build a model portfolio for a Global Custodian Bank with a focus on institutional financing and asset servicing. Please include the following components in the model:  


1. Asset Classes ($ Amounts & % Weights):
   
Sovereign Debt: A large core of high-quality government bonds (e.g., US Treasuries, EU Sovereigns) used for liquidity and collateral.

Corporate Bond Investments: Direct investments in corporate debt held on the bank’s balance sheet.

Loan Commitments: Provide detailed data for both 'Outstanding' (drawn) and 'Total Committed' (total facility) amounts.

Tax Equity / Project Finance: Specific financing for infrastructure and renewable projects.

Capital Markets Activity: A 'Facilitated' book representing underwriting and issuance for client stocks and bonds.

Securities Lending: A tracking category for the flow of client-owned assets lent to the market.


2. Major Sectors:

Distribute the assets above across the following key sectors to simulate real-world exposure:

Financials: Interbank lending and holdings in other financial institutions.

Traditional Oil & Gas: Extraction, refining, and fossil-fuel-based energy.

Renewables: Wind, solar, and battery storage (specifically for Tax Equity/Project Finance).

Industrials & Materials: Heavy manufacturing and infrastructure.

Sovereigns/Public Sector: Government-issued debt and public finance.

Information Technology & Healthcare: Large corporate bond and equity holdings.


3. Financial Requirements:

Please assign realistic Dollar ($) Amounts (based on a $500B – $1T hypothetical balance sheet) and % Weights for each asset class and sector.

For Loan Commitments, clearly separate the $ amount for Total Committed versus the $ amount for Outstanding.



4. Goal of the Model:

I want this model to serve as a baseline for a 'Data Solutions & Controls' exercise. Provide the data in a clear format so I can analyze the relationships and identify where the most complex data overlaps might occur between these buckets.
